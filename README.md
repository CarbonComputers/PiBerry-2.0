The PiBerry 1.8 is a compact, modular cyberdeck built for Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, designed with DIY in mind. Perfect for tech enthusiasts, it combines a traditional 3.5" touchscreen, a Blackberry-style keyboard from Zitao Tech, and flexible power solutions by PiSugar for on-the-go hacking and DIY projects.
